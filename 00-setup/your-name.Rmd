* Rename this file with your name, e.g. from your-name.Rmd to mauro.Rmd.

* The first chunk of an .Rmd file is usually called "setup" and includes options, such as `echo = TRUE`, that modify the output. Kint this document; then add the options `comment = "#>"` and `collapse = TRUE` to `knitr::opts_chunk$set()`, and knit again. Based on your results, explain what these options do?:

  * `echo = TRUE`: ...
  * `collapse = TRUE`: ...
  * `comment = #>`: ...

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

* You can also pass options to specific chunks. Change the chunk `{r situation-report}` to `{r situation-report, comment = ">"}`. Why should chunk comments start with `#` instead of any other symbol (e.g. `>`)?

```{r situation-report}
usethis::git_sitrep()
```

* Submit a pull request including both the .Rmd source and the .md output.
